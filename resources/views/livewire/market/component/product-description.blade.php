            <p class="mb-5">CUPERTINO, CA , The M1 CPU allows Apple to deliver an all-new iMac with a
                lot more compact and impressively thin design. The new iMac delivers tremendous
                performance in an 11.5-millimeter-thin design with a stunning side profile that almost
                vanishes. iMac includes a 24-inch 4.5K Retina display with 11.3 million pixels, 500 nits
                of brightness, and over a billion colors, giving a beautiful and vivid viewing
                experience. It is available in a variety of striking colors to match a user's own style
                and brighten any area. A 1080p FaceTime HD camera, studio-quality mics, and a
                six-speaker sound system are all included in the new iMac, making it the greatest camera
                and audio system ever in a Mac. Touch ID is also making its debut on the iMac, making it
                easier than ever to securely log in, make Apple Pay transactions, and switch user
                accounts with the touch of a finger. Apps launch at lightning speed, everyday chores
                seem astonishingly fast and fluid, and demanding workloads like editing 4K video and
                working with large photos are faster than ever before thanks to the power and
                performance of M1 and macOS Big Sur.</p><a href="../../../assets/img/products/23.png"

            <p class="mb-0">The new iMac joins Apple's fantastic M1-powered Mac family, which
                includes the MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro, and Mac mini, and represents yet another
                step ahead in the company's shift to Apple silicon. Customers may order iMac starting
                Friday, April 30. It's the most personal, powerful, capable, and enjoyable it's ever
                been. In the second half of May, the iMac will be available."M1 is a huge step forward
                for the Mac," said Greg Joswiak, Apple's senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing.
                "Today, we're delighted to present the all-new iMac, the first Mac developed around the
                groundbreaking M1 processor." "The new iMac takes everything people love about iMac to
                an entirely new level, with its beautiful design in seven breathtaking colors, its
                immersive 4.5K Retina display, the greatest camera, mics, and speakers ever in a Mac,
                and Touch ID, combined with M1's incredible performance and macOS Big Sur's power."</p>
